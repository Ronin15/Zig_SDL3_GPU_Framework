# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a Zig SDL3 template. The build entry point is `build.zig`, with package metadata in `build.zig.zon`.

- `src/main.zig` contains the executable entry point and SDL3 window/render loop.
- `src/root.zig` is the reusable package module with library helpers and tests.
- `assets/` contains runtime assets and is installed to `zig-out/bin/assets`.
- `zig-out/` is generated build output and should not be edited by hand.
- Add modules under `src/`; keep executable-only code near `main.zig` and reusable logic in modules imported by `root.zig`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `zig build` builds the executable and installs it to `zig-out/bin/my-sdl3-game`.
- `zig build run` builds, installs runtime assets/shaders, and runs the SDL3 example window.
- `zig build dev` builds shaders, installs assets, and runs the app.
- `zig build test` runs reusable module tests plus SDL-linked compile coverage.
- `zig build check` compiles the game and GPU smoke executable without installing.
- `zig build verify` runs check, tests, and shader compilation.
- `zig build package` installs selected-mode game binaries and runtime assets.
- `zig build shaders` compiles platform GPU shaders.
- `zig build gpu-smoke` runs a display-gated SDL_GPU frame submission check.
- `zig build fmt` formats `build.zig`, `build.zig.zon`, and `src/`.

Default optimize mode is `ReleaseSafe`; override with `zig build --release=fast` or `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast` when needed. SDL3 is a system dependency; install the platform SDL3 development package before building. Shader tools are required for the default runnable build.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow `zig fmt`; use 4-space indentation and avoid manual alignment that the formatter will rewrite. Use Zig-style lowerCamelCase for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for types, and short, descriptive names. Keep error sets explicit when practical, as in `error{SdlError}`.

Prefer small functions with clear ownership of SDL resources. Pair SDL creation calls with `defer` cleanup close to the creation site.

For frame-loop policy, use SDL window flags as current state: throttle visible background windows, but only skip rendering or force pause for hidden, minimized, or no-swapchain frames.

## Testing Guidelines

Use Zig's built-in `test` blocks and `std.testing`. Name tests by behavior, for example `test "player movement clamps to window bounds"`. Put reusable module tests beside the code they cover. Run `zig build test` before submitting changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

This checkout does not include Git history, so no repository-specific commit convention is established. Use concise, imperative commit messages such as `Add SDL input handling` or `Fix renderer cleanup`.

Pull requests should include a short description, testing performed, and any platform details relevant to SDL3 linking or runtime behavior. For visual changes, include a screenshot or short recording of the SDL window when useful.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit generated binaries from `zig-out/` or local machine paths. If adding dependencies to `build.zig.zon`, keep hashes accurate and review changes to the package fingerprint carefully because it affects package identity.
