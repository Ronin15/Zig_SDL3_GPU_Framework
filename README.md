# Zig SDL3 GPU 2D Game

Zig SDL3 GPU 2D Game is a lean real-time 2D project built on Zig 0.16.0,
SDL3, and SDL_GPU. Games are hard because every frame has to process input,
advance simulation, manage state, prepare rendering, and stay within a tight
time budget. This project keeps those responsibilities explicit instead of
letting them blur together in the main loop.

The runtime is organized around a small fixed-step loop, a policy-driven state
stack, an SDL_GPU sprite renderer, asset-backed text and texture services, and
gameplay data stored for direct processor iteration. Movement and particle
systems use dense SoA columns, SIMD paths, and worker-thread batches when there
is enough work to split.

The test suite targets deterministic engine behavior before playtesting takes
over. It verifies state dispatch and queued transitions, modal input gating,
resource and cache lifetime, viewport and sprite batch math, thread scheduling,
worker range splitting, SoA alignment, and SIMD results against scalar updates.

## Design Focus

- **Runtime flow:** `src/main.zig` owns the high-level fixed-step loop, while
  `Engine` coordinates SDL services, pause/frame visibility policy, input,
  state dispatch, and rendering. Gameplay updates run at 60Hz and rendering
  interpolates between simulation ticks.
- **State and input policy:** `StateStack` owns state lifetimes, queued
  transitions, overlays, modal screens, opaque screens, and pass-through rules.
  Raw keyboard input maps to named actions so gameplay input, app commands, and
  debug commands can be routed by the active state policy.
- **SDL_GPU rendering:** game code draws through `Renderer`. GPU device setup,
  swapchain handling, shader loading, texture ownership, batching, presentation,
  and command submission stay in the rendering layers. Shader builds emit SPIR-V
  on Linux and Metal shader output on macOS.
- **Data-oriented processors:** `DataSystem` uses generational entity IDs,
  component masks, and dense typed SoA stores. Movement and particle processors
  have serial paths, SIMD paths, and threaded paths that split rows into owned
  worker ranges.
- **Tested engine contracts:** `zig build test` exercises app, render, asset,
  and gameplay modules. The suite checks behavior such as state transition
  ordering, input gating, stale ID rejection, cache release, viewport math,
  sprite batch grouping, thread scheduling, and SIMD/scalar equivalence.
- **Runtime services:** asset paths are relative and traversal-safe, PNG
  textures load through core SDL3, retained texture leases keep ownership
  explicit, SDL3_ttf text is asset-backed and cached, scoped Zig logging keeps
  diagnostics organized, and F2 toggles the local FPS overlay.

## Requirements

- Zig 0.16.0 or a compatible 0.16.x build
- SDL3 development headers and library
- SDL3_ttf development headers and library
- `glslc` for shader compilation
- `spirv-cross` for macOS Metal shader generation

See [setup](docs/setup.md) for platform package notes.

## Quick Start

```sh
git clone git@github.com:Ronin15/Zig_SDL3_GPU_Framework.git
cd Zig_SDL3_GPU_Framework
zig build
zig build run
```

For the normal edit/run loop:

```sh
zig build dev
```

`zig build dev` compiles shaders, installs assets, builds the executable, and
runs the app.

## Commands

```sh
zig build           # build and install a runnable app into zig-out/bin
zig build run       # build, install assets/shaders, and run the app
zig build dev       # build shaders, install assets, and run the app
zig build check     # compile the game and GPU smoke executable
zig build test      # run Zig unit tests
zig build verify    # run check, test, and shader compilation
zig build package   # install selected-mode binaries and runtime assets
zig build gpu-smoke # create an SDL_GPU device and submit one frame
```

See [development workflow](docs/development-workflow.md) for release modes,
build options, formatting, shader commands, and GPU smoke details.

## Project Layout

- `build.zig` defines executables, tests, formatting, shader compilation, and install steps.
- `build.zig.zon` contains project metadata.
- `src/main.zig` contains the executable entry point and high-level fixed-step timing loop.
- `src/app/` contains SDL app coordination, input routing, timing, pause policy, frame pacing, thread system, and state stack flow.
- `src/render/` contains SDL_GPU rendering, camera transforms, GPU resources, text, and debug overlay rendering.
- `src/game/` contains game/application states, gameplay data, and ECS-style processors.
- `src/platform/` contains SDL/platform integration helpers and GPU smoke-test code.
- `src/assets/` contains runtime asset path resolution, installed-file loading, and cache-backed texture ownership.
- `src/core/` contains small shared helpers.
- `assets/` contains runtime assets, bundled fonts, and shader sources.

Generated build output goes under `zig-out/` and should not be committed.
