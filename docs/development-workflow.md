# Development Workflow

## Common Commands

```sh
zig build           # build and install a runnable app into zig-out/bin
zig build run       # build, install assets/shaders, and run the app
zig build dev       # build shaders, install assets, and run the app
zig build check     # compile the game and GPU smoke executable
zig build test      # run Zig unit tests
zig build bench     # run CPU entity and particle processor benchmarks
zig build verify    # run check, test, and shader compilation
zig build package   # install selected-mode binaries and runtime assets
```

Useful supporting commands:

```sh
zig build fmt       # format build.zig, build.zig.zon, and src/
zig build shaders   # compile GLSL shader sources to platform GPU shaders
zig build gpu-smoke # create an SDL_GPU device and submit one frame
```

`zig build package` installs the selected-mode game binary and runtime assets.
It does not install the `gpu-smoke` development executable.

## Release Modes

The default optimize mode is `Debug`, matching standard Zig build behavior. Use
an explicit release mode only when preparing a release candidate or shipping
build:

```sh
zig build --release=safe
zig build --release=fast
zig build --release=small
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

## Build Options

Customize app metadata at build time:

```sh
zig build -Dapp-name=my-game -Dwindow-title="My Game"
```

Disable the debug overlay feature when you do not want debug UI in a build:

```sh
zig build -Ddebug-overlay=false
```

The default runtime asset directory is `assets`. If you pass
`-Dasset-root=content`, generated shaders and copied runtime assets are installed
under `zig-out/bin/content`, and the executable looks there at runtime.

Use non-default shader compiler paths:

```sh
zig build shaders -Dshader-compiler=/path/to/glslc
zig build shaders -Dshader-cross-compiler=/path/to/spirv-cross
```

SDL_GPU debug validation is enabled by default in Debug builds. Override it with:

```sh
zig build -Dgpu-debug=false
zig build -Dgpu-debug=true
```

Runtime diagnostics use Zig `std.log` filtering. The default `auto` level keeps
Debug builds at `debug` and release builds at `warn`, which still includes
errors. Debug logs can include detailed startup and fallback context, but
warning and error logs should stay rare and actionable. Override the level when
you need a different signal:

```sh
zig build -Dlog-level=warn
zig build -Dlog-level=debug
zig build --release=safe -Dlog-level=err
```

## Testing

Tests follow Zig conventions: small unit tests live beside the code they cover
as `test` blocks. Run them with:

```sh
zig build test
```

For a broader local check before sharing changes:

```sh
zig build verify
```

`verify` runs compile coverage, unit tests, and shader compilation.

## Benchmarks

`zig build bench` runs non-interactive CPU benchmarks for the movement entity
processor and transient particle processor. The default run automatically
exercises serial, inline, fixed-worker, adaptive thread-count,
thread-adaptive-tuned-range, thread-small-range, and thread-large-range cases.
Movement runs a count sweep so threshold changes can be compared across entity
counts; particles use one representative count per profile. Output is grouped
by workload and count, then explains what to tune: per-system parallel
thresholds, adaptive thread count, and items per claimed range. The
adaptive+tuned-range case keeps adaptive thread-count selection enabled, layers
an external items-per-range tuner on top, settles on the best measured
items-per-range value before timing when possible, and reports phase, initial,
final, best, and candidate items-per-range values. In adaptive cases, low-count
processors may stay inline until measured completion time shows that active
worker threads are worth the synchronization cost; forced-inline batches are
timing samples for that batch only and do not reset adaptive thread-count state
for later processors. Use `--details` only when you need the supporting
per-case timings. Use other
optional arguments only to narrow or scale the run:

```sh
zig build bench -- --profile quick
zig build bench -- --profile standard --iterations 100
zig build bench -- --case thread-adaptive
zig build bench -- --details
```

## GPU Smoke

`zig build gpu-smoke` opens a small window long enough to create an SDL_GPU
device, acquire a swapchain texture, and submit one frame. SDL still needs a
usable video backend and display environment, so headless shells or CI runners
may need display setup before this check can run.
