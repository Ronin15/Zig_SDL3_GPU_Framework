# Framework Implementation Slices

This roadmap keeps the repo focused as a clone-and-edit 2D game starter. Each
slice should land as a small, verified step that improves a real extension point
without turning the project into a public library API.

## Ground Rules

- Preserve runnable defaults: `zig build`, `zig build run`, and installed assets
  should keep working after every slice.
- Keep hot paths simple: prefer enums, bitsets, arrays, and generational slot IDs
  over dynamic dispatch, string lookup, or hash maps during input/update/draw.
- Integrate scaffolds only when the first runtime feature needs them.
- Keep `src/root.zig` minimal; feature modules should live in their matching
  `src/` area and import each other directly when needed.
- Run `zig build verify` before considering a slice complete.

## Slice 1: Input Routing

Goal: let modal UI, gameplay, and debug commands control which actions receive
input without broad special cases in `Engine`.

Current foundation:

- `InputState` tracks held gameplay actions.
- `FrameCommands` tracks one-frame commands.
- `input_router.zig` defines context-oriented routing contracts.

Checklist:

- [ ] Add a routing policy field to the active state policy or derive it from the
      active state stack entry.
- [ ] Route SDL key events through `InputRoutingPolicy` before mutating
      `InputState` or `FrameCommands`.
- [ ] Keep debug commands available unless explicitly disabled.
- [ ] Ensure modal overlays can block gameplay held input.
- [ ] Release held gameplay movement when a modal policy starts blocking gameplay.
- [ ] Add tests for gameplay-only, modal UI, pass-through overlay, and debug
      command behavior.
- [ ] Update README input guidance after behavior is wired.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] A gameplay state still receives WASD movement by default.
- [ ] A modal state can prevent gameplay movement from being latched underneath.
- [ ] F2 debug overlay toggle still works while gameplay is active.
- [ ] `zig build test` covers routing behavior without opening a window.

## Slice 2: Logical Resolution And Viewport Policy

Goal: make logical game coordinates deliberate before real UI, resizing, or
high-DPI behavior depends on them.

Current foundation:

- `AppConfig` has `logical_width`, `logical_height`, and `resizable`.
- `resolution.zig` defines logical size, scale mode, and viewport math.
- Renderer currently uses swapchain size directly.

Checklist:

- [ ] Add a `ResolutionPolicy` to `AppConfig`.
- [ ] Compute the current `Viewport` when swapchain/window size changes.
- [ ] Apply the viewport through SDL_GPU render pass or draw transform as
      appropriate for SDL_GPU.
- [ ] Keep world/game drawing in logical coordinates.
- [ ] Decide whether debug overlay is logical-space or screen-space and document it.
- [ ] Add tests for fit, integer-fit, stretch, small windows, and invalid sizes.
- [ ] Update README with resize/logical-resolution behavior.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] Existing demo renders correctly at the default 1280x720 logical size.
- [ ] Resizable windows preserve the configured scale policy.
- [ ] Letterbox offsets are centered and stable.
- [ ] Hidden/minimized/no-swapchain frame policy still behaves as before.

## Slice 3: Render Resource Layer

Goal: replace long-lived raw texture indices with a resource layer that can grow
into caching, reload, and ownership tracking.

Current foundation:

- Renderer owns GPU textures in an array.
- `TextureHandle` is currently a raw index.
- `resources.zig` defines generational `TextureId` and resource descriptors.

Checklist:

- [ ] Add a slot table for textures with generation, alive state, and descriptor.
- [ ] Add `TextureId` creation, validation, lookup, and destruction helpers.
- [ ] Keep draw submission lookup array-backed and allocation-free.
- [ ] Preserve the white texture as an internal renderer resource.
- [ ] Keep `createTextureFromPng`, `createTextureFromPixels`, and
      `replaceTextureFromPixels` behavior compatible during migration.
- [ ] Add tests for stale IDs, destroyed IDs, invalid generation, and descriptor
      validation.
- [ ] Add a focused compatibility note if `TextureHandle` is renamed or aliased.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] Destroyed or stale texture IDs are skipped or rejected deterministically.
- [ ] Existing demo and debug text still render.
- [ ] Texture upload validation still rejects bad dimensions, pitch, and buffer
      lengths before GPU work.
- [ ] No hash map lookup is introduced into per-sprite draw submission.

## Slice 4: Asset Cache

Goal: make runtime asset ownership explicit enough for real projects without
building a broad content pipeline too early.

Current foundation:

- `AssetStore` resolves safe relative paths from repo root or executable-relative
  install location.
- Renderer can load PNGs directly through `createTextureFromPng`.

Checklist:

- [ ] Add an asset/resource cache module that maps stable asset paths to
      renderer resource IDs.
- [ ] Keep path validation in `AssetStore`; do not duplicate traversal checks.
- [ ] Decide cache ownership: app-level service owned by `Engine` is the default.
- [ ] Add explicit load/unload or retain/release policy before adding hot reload.
- [ ] Keep synchronous load first; defer async/staged loading until needed.
- [ ] Add tests for duplicate path reuse, unload behavior, and invalid paths.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] Loading the same PNG twice can reuse the existing texture.
- [ ] Asset paths remain relative and traversal-safe.
- [ ] Installed-binary asset lookup still works with `-Dasset-root`.

## Slice 5: Text And Font Service

Goal: move from FPS-only SDL_ttf usage to asset-backed text rendering suitable
for menus, buttons, and UI.

Current foundation:

- SDL3_ttf is a core dependency.
- `FpsCounter` proves rendered text can become a texture.
- `text.zig` defines asset-backed font and text layout contracts.

Checklist:

- [ ] Add a centralized text/font service that owns `TTF_Init` and `TTF_Quit`.
- [ ] Load fonts from `assets/fonts/...` through `AssetStore`.
- [ ] Add `FontId` allocation and validation using generational IDs.
- [ ] Render text into cached renderer textures.
- [ ] Define cache invalidation for text string, font, color, wrap width, and
      layout options.
- [ ] Move `FpsCounter` to consume the text service.
- [ ] Add at least one bundled font or document the asset requirement clearly.
- [ ] Add tests for descriptor validation and cache keys where possible.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] F2 overlay still renders yellow FPS text.
- [ ] No system font path probing remains in normal text flow.
- [ ] Text texture lifetime is centralized and cleaned up by the owning service.

## Slice 6: Renderer Composition

Goal: split renderer responsibilities so sprites, UI, shapes, tilemaps, and
future effects do not all require editing one monolithic renderer path.

Current foundation:

- Renderer owns SDL_GPU device, window claim, swapchain, pipeline, buffers, and
  sprite batching.
- Build now has a shader-program table for the existing sprite shader pair.

Checklist:

- [ ] Keep `Renderer` as the device/frame coordinator.
- [ ] Move sprite batching internals behind a `SpriteBatch` or equivalent module.
- [ ] Introduce static material/pipeline records for the current sprite pipeline.
- [ ] Keep draw command sorting stable by layer and submission order.
- [ ] Preserve `drawSprite` and `drawRect` as the starter-facing API during the
      first split.
- [ ] Add tests for batch grouping, invalid texture skipping, and ordering.
- [ ] Re-run `gpu-smoke` when display access is available.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] Existing demo output is unchanged.
- [ ] New batcher owns sprite-specific vertex construction.
- [ ] Renderer frame lifecycle still handles `.submitted` and
      `.skipped_no_swapchain` correctly.
- [ ] Adding a second batcher later would not require rewriting device setup.

## Slice 7: Preallocated Thread System And Parallel Render Prep

Goal: add a deterministic, pre-spawned worker system that lets each engine
system use all active workers for CPU work, then finish before the next system
or render phase starts.

Current foundation:

- `Engine` owns app coordination and state-stack update/render flow.
- `TimeLoop` already enforces fixed-step gameplay updates.
- Renderer command submission is currently serial and owns SDL_GPU command
  buffers, swapchain acquisition, vertex upload, and submit.
- Zig 0.16 provides `std.Thread.spawn`, atomics, and `std.Io` blocking
  primitives; this checkout does not rely on a std thread-pool abstraction.

Thread-system design:

- [ ] Add `src/app/thread_system.zig` with `ThreadSystem`,
      `ThreadSystemConfig`, `WorkerId`, `ParallelRange`, `BatchStats`, and a
      deterministic `parallelFor` API.
- [ ] Own `ThreadSystem` from `Engine`; initialize it after SDL/app config is
      known and deinitialize it before allocator teardown.
- [ ] Pre-spawn up to `max_worker_threads` at init with `std.Thread.spawn`.
      Never create or destroy OS threads during gameplay frames.
- [ ] Default worker count to one fewer than `std.Thread.getCpuCount()` when
      possible, reserving the main/render thread; allow config override for
      worker count, stack size, minimum parallel item count, grain size, queue
      capacity, and short spin-before-park behavior.
- [ ] Use preallocated worker records, batch descriptors, completion counters,
      per-worker scratch, and fixed-capacity queues. No frame-batch submission
      may allocate after initialization or explicit reserve calls.
- [ ] Use atomics for hot counters and wake state; use `std.Io.Mutex`,
      `std.Io.Condition`, or `std.Io.Semaphore` only for parking and shutdown
      paths where blocking is expected.
- [ ] Let the main thread participate in submitted batches while waiting so it
      does useful work instead of only acting as a coordinator.
- [ ] Dynamically scale active workers only at batch boundaries based on prior
      batch cost, item count, main-thread wait time, and worker utilization.
      Small batches run inline on the main thread.
- [ ] Stop accepting work during shutdown, wake parked workers, join every
      pre-spawned thread, and assert that no frame batch is still outstanding.

Engine/system integration:

- [ ] Add an update/render-prep context that exposes `thread_system` to states
      or future systems without moving timing policy out of `main.zig`.
- [ ] Keep systems ordered: each system may use the whole worker set, but all
      of its jobs must complete before the next system starts.
- [ ] Allow worker jobs to read immutable snapshots and write only disjoint
      output ranges or per-worker scratch.
- [ ] Keep `StateTransitions`, state-stack mutation, SDL events, SDL window
      calls, and renderer ownership on the main thread.
- [ ] Record batch stats in a lightweight struct that debug overlay or logs can
      consume later without adding hot-path string formatting.

Parallel render-prep design:

- [ ] Keep SDL_GPU command-buffer acquisition, swapchain acquisition, GPU
      upload, render-pass encoding, and submit on the main/render thread for
      the first implementation.
- [ ] Parallelize CPU render prep only: visibility/culling, layer bucketing,
      stable sort by layer and submission sequence, sprite-to-vertex expansion,
      draw-group construction, and per-worker temporary vertex/group buffers.
- [ ] Snapshot texture/resource metadata needed by workers before dispatch so
      worker jobs never observe renderer arrays while they are being mutated.
- [ ] Merge worker outputs on the main thread in deterministic layer and
      sequence order, then upload the final vertex buffer and submit one GPU
      command buffer.
- [ ] Preserve the current serial path and choose it for low command counts,
      low layer counts, unsupported thread targets, or debug comparisons.
- [ ] Defer threaded SDL_GPU command buffers until profiling proves main-thread
      command encoding is the bottleneck. If added later, command buffers must
      be acquired, used, and submitted on the same worker thread; swapchain
      acquisition must remain on the window thread.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] `parallelFor` covers every item exactly once and never writes outside the
      requested range.
- [ ] Batch execution performs no allocations after init/reserve; enforce this
      with a failing allocator in tests.
- [ ] System barriers are deterministic: later systems always see completed
      output from earlier systems.
- [ ] Shutdown wakes and joins parked workers without leaking or deadlocking.
- [ ] Serial and parallel render prep produce identical vertex order, draw
      group order, layer ordering, and invalid-texture skipping for the same
      command input.
- [ ] Existing visible rendering remains swapchain/vsync paced, and
      hidden/minimized/no-swapchain fallback pacing remains unchanged.
- [ ] `zig build test`, `zig build check`, and `zig build verify` pass before
      the slice is considered complete.

## Slice 8: Shader And Platform Expansion

Goal: keep platform support reliable as shader count and target platforms grow.

Current foundation:

- SDL chooses the GPU backend from supplied shader formats.
- macOS builds MSL, Linux builds SPIR-V.
- Runtime selects shader files from SDL-reported supported formats.

Checklist:

- [ ] Extend the shader-program table as new render pipelines are added.
- [ ] Keep generated runtime shader files under `assets/shaders` in the install
      tree.
- [ ] Add explicit Windows target support only when Windows is an active target.
- [ ] Validate the right shader format list for each target OS.
- [ ] Keep runtime backend selection SDL-driven; do not hard-code GPU driver names.
- [ ] Add shader output checks for each supported target path.

Acceptance checks:

- [ ] `zig build shaders` emits the same sprite shader outputs as before.
- [ ] `zig build verify` exercises shader compilation.
- [ ] `zig build gpu-smoke` confirms runtime submission on display-capable hosts.

## Suggested Order

1. Input routing.
2. Logical resolution and viewport policy.
3. Render resource layer.
4. Asset cache.
5. Text and font service.
6. Renderer composition.
7. Preallocated thread system and parallel render prep.
8. Shader and platform expansion.

This order keeps gameplay/menu correctness ahead of larger renderer work, then
builds resource ownership before text/UI, renderer composition, and parallel
render preparation depend on it.
