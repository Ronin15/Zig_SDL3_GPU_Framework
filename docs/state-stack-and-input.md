# State Stack And Input

## State Shape

Create a state struct with the methods used by `src/app/state.zig`:

```zig
const state_mod = @import("../app/state.zig");
const RenderContext = state_mod.RenderContext;
const StateTransitions = state_mod.StateTransitions;
const UpdateContext = state_mod.UpdateContext;
const c = @import("../platform/sdl.zig").c;

pub const MyState = struct {
    pub fn init() MyState {
        return .{};
    }

    pub fn deinit(self: *MyState) void {
        _ = self;
    }

    pub fn handleEvent(
        self: *MyState,
        event: *const c.SDL_Event,
        transitions: *StateTransitions,
    ) !bool {
        _ = self;
        _ = event;
        _ = transitions;
        return false;
    }

    pub fn update(self: *MyState, context: UpdateContext) !void {
        _ = self;
        _ = context.input;
        _ = context.delta_seconds;
        _ = context.transitions;
        _ = context.thread_system;
    }

    pub fn render(self: *MyState, context: RenderContext) !void {
        _ = self;
        _ = context.renderer;
        _ = context.asset_cache;
        _ = context.text_service;
        _ = context.interpolation_alpha;
        _ = context.thread_system;
    }

    pub fn onPause(self: *MyState) void {
        _ = self;
    }

    pub fn onResume(self: *MyState) void {
        _ = self;
    }
};
```

Return `true` from `handleEvent` when the state consumes an event.

## Transitions

Use `StateTransitions` from inside a state when a change should happen after the
current dispatch finishes:

```zig
try context.transitions.replaceGameplay(MainMenuState, MainMenuState.init());
try context.transitions.pushModal(PauseMenuState, PauseMenuState.init());
try context.transitions.pushOverlay(HudState, HudState.init());
try context.transitions.pushOpaque(LoadingState, LoadingState.init());
try context.transitions.quit();
```

Use `StateStack` directly only in app/bootstrap code, such as replacing the
startup state in `src/app/engine.zig`.

`StateStack` owns state allocation and destruction. It calls `deinit` when
states are removed or replaced, and destroys remaining states from top to bottom
when the stack shuts down.

## Policies

- `replaceGameplay` installs a normal gameplay/screen state.
- `pushModal` blocks updates and events below it while still rendering lower states.
- `pushOverlay` allows updates, events, and rendering below it.
- `pushOpaque` blocks rendering below it for full-screen replacement views.

Policies also control named-action routing:

- Gameplay states allow held gameplay input, app commands, and debug commands.
- Modal overlays block held gameplay input while keeping app and debug commands
  available.
- Pass-through overlays allow gameplay, UI, app, and debug action contexts unless
  a modal or opaque state in the active event path blocks held gameplay input.
- Opaque screens block gameplay input and keep app and debug commands available.

The top state controls command availability. Held gameplay input is also gated
by modal and opaque states in the active event path, so pass-through overlays do
not tunnel movement through a modal state beneath them.

## Input Model

Keyboard input maps to named `Action` values in `src/app/input.zig`.

Held gameplay input:

- `moveLeft`
- `moveRight`
- `moveUp`
- `moveDown`

One-frame commands:

- `pause`
- `resumeGame`
- `quit`
- `toggleDebugOverlay`

`pause`, `resumeGame`, and `quit` are app commands. `toggleDebugOverlay` is a
debug command.

Default bindings are:

- WASD for movement
- P for pause or resume
- Enter or Space for resume
- Escape for quit
- F2 for the debug overlay

Gameplay code should read movement through `InputState`, usually from the
`UpdateContext`. App-level commands should stay in `FrameCommands` and engine
coordination code. `State.handleEvent` still receives raw SDL events according
to `events_below`; input routing only decides whether named actions mutate
`InputState` or `FrameCommands`.
